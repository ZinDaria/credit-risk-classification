# credit-risk-classification
 
## Overview
In this challenge, we aim to develop a predictive model to assess loan risk using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The primary goal is to build a model capable of identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers by analyzing various features in the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about past lending activities, including details about borrowers and their loan performance. Key features include financial indicators, borrower characteristics, and loan outcome labels (healthy or high-risk).

## Activities
### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Handle missing data, outliers, and any data preprocessing necessary for model training.
### 2. Addressing Imbalanced Classes
Recognize and handle class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring fair representation of both healthy and high-risk loans.
### 3. Model Training
Implement a logistic regression model to predict loan risk.
Utilize oversampling techniques to balance the class distribution and enhance model performance.
### 4. Model Evaluation
Assess the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interpret the results and understand how well the model predicts both healthy and high-risk loans.

## Conclusion
This challenge provides an opportunity to apply various techniques in machine learning, from data preprocessing to addressing class imbalance and building predictive models. The insights gained will contribute to a better understanding of loan risk prediction and its practical applications in the financial sector.
